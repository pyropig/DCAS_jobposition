It’s common to hear in the media that the companies complain that they can’t find workers to fill open roles while some job seekers remain desperate that they can not even get a job after filling out hundreds of applications. Another common scenario is that the job openings and average salary statistical data varies a lot among different college major. It’s quiet interesting to dive into the job market area and trying to dig out some fun aspects. To help people stay informed about the current New York City job market, we conducted our research on the data provided by the Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS) of New York, which contains current job postings available on the City of New York’s official jobs site. Our analysis will be focus on the employer’s consideration: What’s the most demand jobs? What’s the highest paid jobs? The average time for an employer to find a qualified candidate? By analyzing "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 Collection 2.2 Data set intro 2.3 Issues and Problems", " Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 Collection The choice of this dataset is made by the group while choosing the topic for the project. We first decide to do something with the topic of job offer, then come across this dataset. The dataset is collected and provided by the Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS) and published on NYC Open data (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/NYC-Jobs/kpav-sd4t) There were a handful of other choice available on the internet, but we choose DCAS’s data. This dataset has around three thousand rows each as a job post (till Nov 16) which is large in quantity, yet it also has 30 columns which contain a vast range of different information about each job post. More important is, the data is directly from the officals without pre-modifications made. Compared to other datasets on the web which could possibly contain underlying bias, this one win in both quantity and quality. 2.2 Data set intro 2.2.1 General information This dataset contains various information about current job postings available on the City of New York’s official jobs site (http://www.nyc.gov/html/careers/html/search/search.shtml). As it is updating quickly on a weekly basis, we’re using the Nov 16th version of the data which stores in the resource folder of the project. The dataset contains a total of 2838 rows with 30 columns. Each row in dataset represents a jobpost once posted on New York’s job site from April 18, 2013 till November 16, 2021. 2.2.2 Columns information Looking at the columns, there are self-explanatory ones but there’s also columns with vague name. Here we introduce some columns need explanations. The first important column is the job id column correspond to the number representing the job post in the agency’s system. However, this id is not unique since one job posting could have two types, external and internal, recorded in column ‘posting type’. Next is the Title Classification, This is a title jurisdiction classification, each job falls in one of the following five categories represented by a number : Competitive - 1, Pending Classification - 2, Labor - 3, Exempt - 4 and Non-Competitive - 5. The job title also has a level assignment correspond to the work duties assigned to that position, this info is recorded in ‘Level’ column. With 0-1 level means interns and part-time workers, 2 meaning normal full-time worker, and 3-4 meaning lower to higher management worker. There’s two column with very similar name, Work Location and Work Location 1. This is not a duplication however, Work Location column records the location of agency posting the job, and Work Location 1 records the actual working place where employee goes every day. The last three column are all with dates, while date format is in MM/DD/YY. There’s one column here need special care: ‘Post Until’ column records the last data that, a job vacancy was be posted. There needs to be a vacancy inorder to be posted, thus a NA value here indicate the job is fully filled. Only when a job posting being withdrawn without filled will it leave record in this column. 2.3 Issues and Problems No known issues is given by the data provider, but when check data we found there’s some complete duplicating rows. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation The data in column Title.Classification and Level are categorical, thus need to be changed from initial readings which is characters. The classification is transformed in a following basis: Competitive - 1, Pending Classification - 2, Labor - 3, Exempt - 4 and Non-Competitive - 5. The level have 0-4 integer leveling, however M1 ~ M4 exist representing minor 1 ~ minor 4. The record with these minor level is few in number thus converted to corresponding higher levels for analysis. There are also special cases which occur less than ten times, these cases are dropped. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Graphing 4.2 Analysis", " Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Graphing 4.2 Analysis 4.2.1 Columns with major missing (&gt;50%) Following the graph, it is obvious that there are four columns with more than 50% of data missing. The first one, Recruitment Contact, is completely filled with NAs. This column is supposed to store the contact information of recruitment. It might be privacy consideration, or it might be the data collector found they can’t collect this data after they created the data frame. Whichever it was, with full NA in the column, this one should be discarded for future analysis. Second most missing data is the Hour and Shift column. This column is supposed to store weekly working hours or shifts, but its not possible every job has this info when posting for hiring. Thus this is not a surprising discovery. The third in the list is the column Post Until. This column is specially commented that a missing value here means the job is posted until fully filled. It is in fact a time stamp here, which means the job offer is being withdrawn without hiring enough people. This is showing around 63% of job positions are fully filled over the span. The fourth is Work location 1. This column, different from Work location which stores Agency location, stores specific work location of the employees. It is obvious that agency location is always fixed and thus is fully given in data, and the working location of employee is varying thus not frequently recorded. It might because that the job doesn’t have a fixed place to work at, or the working place is TBA. Either way, it makes this column missing over 50% of the values. It is worth noting that although not over 50%, the fifth in the list also has a quite large portion of data missing compared to other columns. It is the column Additional Information, which stores the additional information about the corresponding job position. Maybe there isn’t much info to post after all. 4.2.2 Frequent pattern of missing data The most frequent pattern consists of the four major missing columns, taking up over 13% of the total patterns. When adding the fifth most missing column, the second frequent pattern comes and take around 12% of the total patterns. These two are the most dominating patterns. The following patterns are a combination of the four major missing columns. An interesting pattern here is that only contains the Post Until frequently missing column (disregarding the fully missing column Recruitment Contact). With the fact that this missing value indicates whether the job is posted until fully filled, it shows that there’s a lot of good data for analysis. For the patterns who are missing some of the four major missing information but do have the column Post Until, they are the great data samples to investigate how the missing of those info affects people applying for these jobs? Other patterns with the missing of elements outside the major four columns are minor in percentage and could possibly be ignored and removed for analysis. Overall, this data set is pretty good on completeness. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Job openings 5.2 Job level and classification", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Job openings One of the most frequently asked questions about the employment is that what are the most in-demanding jobs. In this dataset, each record includes the details about the concrete business title, job Category and corresponding career level of this job. We aim to provide some insights about the trend of New York City official jobs. 5.1.1 The most in-demanding job categories. The occupational group in which the posted job belongs, such as: Administration &amp; Human Resources,Communications &amp; Intergovernmental Affairs,Constituent Services &amp; Community Programs ,Engineering, Architecture, &amp; Planning,Finance, Accounting, &amp; Procurement ,Health, Technology, Data &amp; Innovation, Legal Affairs,Building Operations &amp; Maintenance,Policy, Research &amp; Analysis,Public Safety, Inspections, &amp; Enforcement,Social Services,Information Technology &amp; Telecommunications. We divided each job into its corresponding category and examined the number of released job opportunities of each category. 5.1.2 The top 25 in-demanding business title In this section, we set our sight on the specific business title. By analyzing this, we try to dig out what kind of skills and roles are most needed by New York City service. 5.2 Job level and classification In the dataset, each job post is categorized by two factor, Title Classification and Level. While classification represented by a number : Competitive - 1, Pending Classification - 2, Labor - 3, Exempt - 4 and Non-Competitive - 5 and higher leveling higher position in the agency structure. Viewing data on level difference, we can see that among all level of jobs, labor and exempt title is quite small in amount. This could be related to the fact this data is collected by government agency focusing on goverment hiring, which indeed need less pure-labor worker than office workers. 5.2.1 Lower level job titles On level 0 which represent part-time jobs, the competitive jobs and non-competitive jobs are almost even, this could be the fact that part-time worker is needed among all positions, creating a balanced distribution. On level 1 representing interns, the competitive jobs remains the same portion while unclassified jobs increase dramatically. This could be the nature of interns which newcomers are not fulling integrated in the agency’s system, thus creating lots of unclassified jobs. 5.2.2 higher level job titles On level 2-4 the competitive portion is significantly higher than lower level jobs. This indicate a competition intensive job environment in government agency, no matter mid to low lever full-time workers or higher level managment workser, they all have high competitive job percentage. Level 4 however do have a slightly lower competitve level compared to level 2 and 3, marking the highest managing works are less competitive. This could because of that level 4 jobs are rare and not much people are qualified and applied to those jobs. Viewing from another perspective, we can see competitive positions - 5 are packed in level 0 jobs while non-competitive positions are evenly distributed among different levels except level 4. Unclassified titles are mostly in level 1 which is interns. This is mostly consistent with previous findings.
