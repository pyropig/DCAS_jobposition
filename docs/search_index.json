We first decide to do something with the topic of job offer, then come across this dataset. The dataset is collected and provided by the Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS) and published on NYC Open data (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/NYC-Jobs/kpav-sd4t) There were a handful of other choice avaliable on the internet, but we choose DCASs data. This dataset has around three thousand rows each as a job post (till Nov 16) which is large in quantity, yet it also has 30 columns which contain a vast range of different information about each job post. More important is, the data is directly from the officals without pre-modifications made. Compared to other datasets on the web which could possibly contain underlying bias, this one win in both quantity and quality. 2.2 Data set intro 2.2.1 General information This dataset contains various information about current job postings available on the City of New Yorks official jobs site (http://www.nyc.gov/html/careers/html/search/search.shtml). As it is updating quickly on a weekly basis, were using the Nov 16th version of the data which stores in the resource folder of the project. The dataset contains a total of 2838 rows with 30 columns. Each row in dataset represents a jobpost once posted on New Yorks job site from April 18, 2013 till November 16, 2021. 2.2.2 Columns information Looking at the columns, there are self-explanatory ones but theres also columns with vague name. Here we introduce some columns need explainations. The first important column is the job id column correspond to the number representing the job post in the agencys system. However, this id is not unique since one job posting could have two types, external and internal, recorded in column posting type. Next is the Title Classification, This is a title jurisdiction classification, each job falls in one of the following seven categories: Competitive, Cultural, Exempt, Labor, Non-Competitive, Pending Classification and Unclassified Service. The job title also has a level assignment correspond to the work duties assigned to that position, this info is recorded in Level column. Theres two column with very similar name, Work Location and Work Location 1. This is not a duplication however, Work Location column records the location of agency posting the job, and Work Location 1 records the actual working place where employee goes every day. The last three column are all with dates, while date format is in MM/DD/YY. Theres one column here need special care: Post Until column records the last data that, a job vacancy was be posted. There needs to be a vacancy inorder to be posted, thus a NA value here indicate the job is fully filled. Only when a job posting being withdrawn without filled will it leave record in this column. 2.3 Issues and Problems No known issues is given by the data provider, but when check data we found theres some complete duplicating rows. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Graphing 4.2 Analysis", " Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Graphing 4.2 Analysis 4.2.1 Columns with major missing (&gt;50%) Following the graph, it is obvious that there are four columns with more than 50% of data missing. The first one, Recruitment Contact, is completely filled with NAs. This column is supposed to store the contact information of recruitment. It might be privacy consideration, or it might be the data collector found they cant collect this data after they created the data frame. Whichever it was, with full NA in the column, this one should be discarded for future analysis. Second most missing data is the Hour and Shift column. This column is supposed to store weekly working hours or shifts, but its not possible every job has this info when posting for hiring. Thus this is not a surprising discovery. The third in the list is the column Post Until. This column is specially commented that a missing value here means the job is posted until fully filled. It is in fact a time stamp here, which means the job offer is being withdrawn without hiring enough people. This is showing around 63% of job positions are fully filled over the span. The fourth is Work location 1. This column, different from Work location which stores Agency location, stores specific work location of the employees. It is obvious that agency location is always fixed and thus is fully given in data, and the working location of employee is varying thus not frequently recorded. It might because that the job doesnt have a fixed place to work at, or the working place is TBA. Either way, it makes this column missing over 50% of the values. It is worth noting that although not over 50%, the fifth in the list also has a quite large portion of data missing compared to other columns. It is the column Additional Information, which stores the additional information about the corresponding job position. Maybe there isnt much info to post after all. 4.2.2 Frequent pattern of missing data The most frequent pattern consists of the four major missing columns, taking up over 13% of the total patterns. When adding the fifth most missing column, the second frequent pattern comes and take around 12% of the total patterns. These two are the most dominating patterns. The following patterns are a combination of the four major missing columns. An interesting pattern here is that only contains the Post Until frequently missing column (disregarding the fully missing column Recruitment Contact). With the fact that this missing value indicates whether the job is posted until fully filled, it shows that theres a lot of good data for analysis. For the patterns who are missing some of the four major missing information but do have the column Post Until, they are the great data samples to investigate how the missing of those info affects people applying for these jobs? Other patterns with the missing of elements outside the major four columns are minor in percentage and could possibly be ignored and removed for analysis. Overall, this data set is pretty good on completeness.
